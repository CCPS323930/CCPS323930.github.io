        <p>I am looking towards success in my personal life, in my professional life I want to be an NFL player. The experiences that led me to choosing that is playing football since a really young age and over time it has become a dream for me to play at the highest level possible. I am working towards these goals by choosing any task in my day and making sure its complete or successful at it. For football I am working out and practicing my craft everyday. I am eating correctly and sleeping correctly so that I can be in the best shape possible. Values that I consider most necessary for my success is being loyal, responsible, and honest. Those 3 values are good values to have within myself to be a successful person. Some short term goals I hope to accomplish in the future is having a good amount of money saved in my bank account, finishing freshman year with over a 3.3 GPA. I also want to pass Geometry ands Biology end of the year exams. Some character traits and achievements I want to be known for is a friendly and dependable person.
